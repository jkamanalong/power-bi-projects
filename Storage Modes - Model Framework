Getting data from NoSQL database:
- Get Data > More > Azure > Azure Cosmos DB > Connect > Enter database credentials

Getting data from online services: Sharepoint, OneDrive, Dynamic 365, Google Analytics
- Get Data > Online Services > Sharepoint online list
- Click connect > Supply the sharepoint url from the site
- Delete the last parts of your url to make sure you see all lists available
- Click ok after, and sign in with your account
- Select list you want to load

Storage modes:
1. Import - Creates a local copy of data for power BI. Can use all power BI service features when using this mode
2. directQuery - Directly connected to the source. Used for large semantic models. 
3. Dual (Composite) - Mix

Fix performance issues
* SQL Server fine tuning techniques
    * Index creation
    * Hardware upgrades
    * Execution plan tuning
    * Data compression
* Query Folding
    * Transformation and edits are done in the SQL query select statements
    * Also, by using power query editor when loading data
    * Compatible with DirectQuery and Dual storage modes. 
* Query diagnostics
    * Tools > Start diagnostics > Stop when finished
* Separate date/time

Data import errors
* Query timeout expired: When pulling too much data according to the organization’s policies
* We couldn't find any data formatted as a table
    * Open excel file and ctrl+T
* Couldn’t find file: Update the source location
* Data type errors:
    * Double check data type from source

Power Query Editor doable actions: 
* Renaming - columns and tables
* Changing data types
* Removing rows/columns
* Merging and appending tables  
* Profiling dataset
    * View > column distribution, column quality, and column profile
    * Column Distribution - spread of data showing frequency
    * Column Quality - counts of valid, error, and empty/null
    * Column Profile - stat data
    * View > Advanced editor for editing M queries
* Setting first row as headers /more…

Model framework
* Star schema: 
    * Dimension tables
    * Fact table
* Import model
* Includes calculated tables defined in DAX formulas. Stored entirely in memory
    * 1-GB limit per dataset
    * Data reduction strategies:
        * Remove columns/rows, 
        * Group by and summarize, increase grain of fact tables
        * Disable auto date/time
    * Refresh - max of 48 times per day
* DirectQuery Model
    * Can enforce RLS
    * Supports RDBMS. Can connect to a remote model and convert it to local model. Technique is chaining models. 
        * Can extend the model with calculated columns/tables, or add new import or directquery tables. 
        * Extension results to creation of new source groups. The extended model becomes a composite model. 
    * Limitations:
        * Not all data sources are supported. 
        * All Power Query (M) transformations are not possible (pivot and unpivoting is not possible).   
    * How to optimize?
        * Add user-defined aggregation tables hidden from users, calculations, and RLS. 
* Dual (Composite) Model: 
    * Known as a limited relationship
    * Boosting performance?
        * Import aggregation tables
