Power BI Administration & Governance Guide
Workspaces in Power BI Service
  Power BI Service is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that organizes content into workspaces, reports, semantic models (datasets), dashboards, and apps.
  Workspaces
  Workspaces serve as containers for Power BI content and enable team collaboration. There are two main types:

- My Workspace – personal space for individual drafting and testing.
- Shared Workspaces – designed for team collaboration and content sharing.

License Modes and Capabilities
Different licenses unlock varying levels of features and sharing:
    1. Pro – basic sharing and collaboration, but no advanced AI visuals or premium features.
    2. Premium Per User (PPU) – full Premium capabilities for the licensed user, though content remains accessible only to other PPU users.
    3. Premium Capacity – unlimited sharing within capacity limits and full feature access.
    4. Embedded – tailored for integrating Power BI into custom applications.
    5. Fabric Capacity – highest tier, supporting all Power BI and Microsoft Fabric features.
 
Workspace Roles and Permissions
  - Viewer – read-only access.
  - Contributor – can create, edit, and delete content, but cannot manage workspace settings or user roles.
  - Member – all Contributor permissions plus ability to manage workspace settings, publish/update apps, and invite users.
  - Admin – complete control, including adding/removing members, deleting the workspace, and managing all settings.

Other Key Content Types
  - Reports – published .pbix files available within a workspace.
  - Semantic Models (Datasets) – the underlying data sources that power published reports.
  - Dashboards – single-page summaries built by pinning visuals (tiles) from one or more reports in the workspace.
  - Apps – curated collections of related reports and dashboards for easy distribution to wider audiences.

Managing Semantic Models
- Power BI Gateway (for On-Premises Data)
- The gateway acts as a secure bridge between the cloud-based Power BI Service and on-premises data sources.

- Standard Mode – supports multiple users and multiple data sources (recommended for shared reports).
- Personal Mode – limited to a single user and cannot be shared.
- Cloud sources such as SharePoint, OneDrive, or Azure SQL do not require a gateway.

Scheduled Refresh
  To keep data up to date:
    - Configure the gateway connection in Power BI Service.
    - Navigate to the workspace, hover over the semantic model, and click the Schedule Refresh icon.
    - Enable Scheduled Refresh and define the desired frequency.

Incremental Refresh (for Large Datasets)
  This feature dramatically improves refresh performance:
    - In Power Query Editor, go to Home → Manage Parameters and create two Date/Time parameters: RangeStart and RangeEnd.
    - Apply a filter on your date column using these parameters (e.g., Date >= RangeStart && Date < RangeEnd).
    - Right-click the query table → Incremental Refresh → configure archive and refresh periods.

Endorsement and Promotion
  - Promotion – highlights valuable content for users.
  - Certification – reserved for authoritative, trusted semantic models (requires admin approval).

Query Caching (Performance Boost)
  - Available for Fabric, Premium, and Embedded capacities. Enable it via workspace settings → semantic model → Query caching.
  - Lineage and Impact Analysis
  - Provides visibility into relationships between artifacts (requires Contributor or higher role).

Semantic Model Impact Analysis – reveals which reports and dashboards would be affected by changes.
Data Source Impact Analysis – identifies dependent semantic models.

Content Distribution and Security
  Role Permissions Recap
    - Viewer – the only role that enforces Row-Level Security (RLS).
    - Contributor – cannot manage workspace settings or assign roles.
    - Member – can manage users/roles and publish apps.
    - Admin – full administrative control.

Creating and Publishing Apps
  - In the workspace, click Create app.
  - On the Content tab, select the reports and dashboards to include.
  - On the Permissions tab, define the target audience (entire organization or specific users/groups).
  - Publish or update the app.

Data Alerts
  - Available only in Power BI Service on KPI or gauge visuals. Set thresholds to receive email or mobile notifications when values cross limits.
  - Row-Level Security (RLS)
  - Static RLS
  - Ideal for fixed filters (e.g., department-based):

In Power BI Desktop → Modeling → Manage Roles.
  - Create a role and add a DAX filter expression.
  - Test using View as.
  - Publish the report.
  - In Power BI Service, assign users/groups to the roles.

Dynamic RLS (Recommended for User-Based Filtering)
  Creates a single flexible role:
    - Use a filter such as [Email] = USERPRINCIPALNAME().
    - USERPRINCIPALNAME() consistently returns the user's email address in both Desktop and Service.
    - Avoid USERNAME() due to format differences (DOMAIN\user in Desktop vs. UPN in Service).

Single Sign-On (SSO) for DirectQuery Sources
  - On-Premises (Kerberos): In Service → Manage Gateways → edit data source → enable SSO.
  - Cloud (Azure AD): Edit credentials → select OAuth2 → enable SSO.

Object-Level Security (OLS)
  OLS restricts access to entire tables or specific columns.
  Configuration steps in Power BI Desktop:
    - Enable the preview feature: File → Options and settings → Options → Preview features → Store datasets using TMDL.
    - Open TMDL view and edit role definitions (set Table = None or Column = None).
    - By default, all objects are accessible (Read permission). Setting an object to None hides it completely from the role.
