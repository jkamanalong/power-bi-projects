Semantic Model Configuration
* Fine tuning relationships
    * Affects filter propagation to other tables.
    * Model view: Manage relationship window
    * Column to column relationship: Matching data types
    * Understand cardinality
    * Understand cross-filter direction. Minimize cross filters to both directions. 
        * Only one filter propagation can be active between two tables
        * Using USERELATIONSHIP:
            * USERELATIONSHIP function in Power BI DAX is used when you have two or more relationships between the same tables but only one can be active at a time
            * If you want to calculate Sales by Ship Date instead of Order Date:
Sales by Ship Date =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[ShipDate], 'Date'[Date])
)
            * Initially, it is connected to order date and we swapped ship date for it. 
* Set table and column properties
    * Go into model view and open properties pane
        * Renaming
        * Adding descriptions
        * Mark date tables
        * Hide key columns
        * Update category
        * Set summarization
        * Configure hierarchies
        * Add measures
        * Set parameters
            * Numeric range parameter: 
                * Setup min, max, increment, default values. 
                * Creates a disconnected table
                * Use parameter in measures: 
                    * Sales with Growth =
                    * [Total Sales] * (1 + 'Growth Rate Parameter'[Growth Rate Parameter Value])
            * Fields parameter:
                * Could be columns (Category, Region, Year) or measures (Sales, Profit, Quantity)
                * Drop field paramter in x-axis or y-axis, legend, or values of a report. 
                * Examples: 
                    * Dimension selector: Region, Category, Segment to an axis of a chart
                    * Measure selector: Place in values
                    * Can also combine both by creating dimension and measure fields parameter. 
* Create other model objects
    * Hierarchies
    * Measures
    * Parameters
