Optimization
* Techniques:
    * Data types must be correct/uniform
    * Remove unnecessary rows/columns
    * Avoid repeating values
    * Surface numeric columns as measures
    * Reduce column cardinality
    * Analyze model metadata
    * Summarize data where possible
* Analyze performance:
    * Clearing data cache:
        * Restart power BI desktop
        * Create a new page
        * Connect to DAX Studio and invoke clear cache function in the advanced tab
    * View > Performance analyzer
        * Start recording
        * Select page of report to analyze
        * Interact with the elements inside that page
        * Stop recording and then analyze results
    * Results anatomy:
        * DAX Query - Querying data time
        * Visual Display - Rendering time
        * Other - DAX queries / No. of visuals in the report
    * Resolving Techniques: 
        * Visuals - Adding tooltips / Drill-through pages
        * DAX Query - Filter vs Keepfilter. Filter(‘Table’, ‘Table[column] = “value”)
        * Semantic model - Disable auto date/time option. 
            * Relationships - Ensure correct relationships
            * Columns - Remove at the source. Avoid deletion at power query editor. 
            * Auto-date/time: File>Options and settings > Options > Data load > Time intelligence
        * Use variables in measures that are complicated
        * Reduce cardinality
        * Optimize directQuery models with table level storage. 
        * Create aggregations: Import or create a new table
            * Load as import mode
            * Define relationships with dimension tables
            * Keys in aggregation table should align with the detail table’s dimension keys
            * Mark the table as aggregation table
            * Choose an aggregation function for each column after mapping them to the detail table.
